# EvolutionaryPredatorPreyRobots
## Molly Eaton

Final project for an evolutionary algorithms course where I trained robots to act as predator and prey using Pyrosim

To run this program you will need to have Pyrosim properly installed on your device. Once all files are within the pyrosim-master folder you can then run the files.
All files are run via the projectController.py file. 

There are multiple stages of evolution for both the prey and the predator robots. They begin with stationary objects and move to moving objects. Once the generations 
have finished processing the 'most fit' individuals are then displayed producing the expected behavior.
